Pseudocode:
1. Declare float variable for original_price.

2. Declare float variable for current_price.

3. Calculate the difference between current_price and original_price and assign it to a variable increase.
    increase = current_price - original_price

4. Calculate percent increase using the formula:
    percent_increase = (increase / original_price) * 100

5. Declare float variable for threshold, set it to 20 (assuming this represents 20% change in stock price).

6. Implement if-else logic:

    IF percent_increase is greater than or equal to threshold:
        Print "Buy the Netflix stock."
    
    ELSE IF percent_increase is less than or equal to -threshold:
        Print "Sell the Netflix stock."
    
    ELSE:
        Print "Hold the Netflix stock, no significant change in price."
